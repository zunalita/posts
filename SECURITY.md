Zunalita operates on principles of trust, transparency, and responsibility. This policy defines the standards that protect our community and ensure that the /posts directory remains safe, reliable, and free from harmful content.

All shared content must respect privacy, follow ethical standards, and avoid any form of technical or informational harm. Posts that violate these principles may be removed without prior notice.

If you find any post that appears malicious, deceptive, or unsafe, please report it immediately using the secure issue form at:
https://github.com/zunalita/posts/issues/new?template=report_malicious_post.yml

All reports are reviewed within 72 hours. Confirmed violations will lead to the removal or archival of the post, with a public record of the decision when appropriate.

Zunalita enforces strict measures to protect users and maintain platform integrity. By contributing, you agree to uphold these standards and help preserve a secure and transparent environment.
