## 🎯 Step-by-Step Guide

### 1️⃣ Set Up Your Server

- Create a new Discord server, name it after your podcast.
- Add a **voice channel** where you and your co-hosts/guests will talk.
- Configure permissions to keep unwanted users out during recordings.

### 2️⃣ Invite Your Co-Hosts and Guests

- Share an invite link with your team.
- Agree on a schedule and topic for your episode.

### 3️⃣ Improve Audio Quality

- Encourage everyone to use headphones to avoid echo.
- Enable “Push-to-Talk” or adjust noise suppression in Discord’s settings.

### 4️⃣ Record the Session

You can record your podcast in two main ways:

🎥 **Using OBS Studio**  
- Open OBS, add an *Audio Output Capture* source set to Discord.
- Hit record when you start your show.

🤖 **Using Craig Bot (for Discord)**  
- Invite [Craig](https://craig.chat/) bot to your server.
- Type `/join` in the voice channel to begin recording. Craig will DM you links to download the audio after.

### 5️⃣ Edit and Publish

- Use a free editor like Audacity to cut out noise and polish your recording.
- Export your audio and upload it to platforms like Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or Anchor.
