As Zunalita moves toward 2026, the project enters a new stage of maturity. What began as a minimal and independent space for sharing ideas, projects, reflections, and technical content is now preparing for a broader transformation that goes beyond visual changes.

The site will go through a significant redesign focused on clarity, accessibility, and consistency. The goal is to make reading more comfortable, navigation more intuitive, and the overall experience more cohesive across different devices. The new appearance will remain faithful to Zunalita’s minimalist identity, but with a more refined structure that better supports long-form content and future growth.

Security and privacy will be treated as fundamental pillars in this next phase. Zunalita will strengthen its foundations to protect content, interactions, and infrastructure, with improvements aimed at reducing exposure to common vulnerabilities and increasing overall reliability. At the same time, we want to be explicit about our position on user data: Zunalita does not collect user data for marketing purposes at this time. If, in the future, any form of data collection becomes necessary, it will be clearly communicated and strictly optional. User choice and transparency will remain non-negotiable.

Alongside visual and structural improvements, new features are being designed to enhance engagement in a meaningful and respectful way. Concepts such as reading rewards are being explored to encourage learning and exploration without turning the platform into a source of noise or excessive tracking. Internal refactoring and functional improvements will also prepare the site for better performance, scalability, and future tools, always guided by simplicity and purpose.

This evolution is not about making Zunalita bigger or louder. It is about making it better. The focus for 2026 is to deliver a platform that is more robust, more secure, and more comfortable to use, while staying true to its original purpose: a space where content matters more than metrics, and trust matters more than growth.

The next chapter of Zunalita is already taking shape, and it is being built with care, intention, and long-term vision.

The next Zunalita update is officially scheduled for February 1, 2026. This release will mark the beginning of the changes outlined above, introducing the first wave of visual, structural, and security improvements. As always, updates will be deployed carefully and transparently, with a focus on stability and respect for the reading experience.

Fanzines will also play an important role in Zunalita’s future. They represent a more independent, experimental, and expressive format, allowing ideas to be explored outside traditional structures. Through fanzines, Zunalita aims to publish content that values creativity, critical thinking, and freedom of expression, while remaining accessible and intentional. This format reinforces our commitment to alternative publishing and to giving space to voices, topics, and perspectives that do not always fit into conventional platforms.
